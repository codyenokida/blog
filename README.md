# Blogs by Kota Cody Enokida

This is a personal blog bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and storage/db with [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com). 

## Overview

It's a simple blogging website with built-in editing and a blog post creation feature on the go :) It's all "open-source" so feel free to take a look. This is all personal just to share memories and thoughts.
